# Decisions

Why things are the way they are. Add an entry when a choice would surprise someone later.

## Platform
- **Forge 47.4.16, not NeoForge.** On 1.20.1 NeoForge is frozen at 47.1.x; Serene
  Seasons, BOP, TAN, Trading Floor and VS2 all require Forge ≥ 47.2–47.3.
- **1.20.1** for Create 6 addon coverage (Steam 'n' Rails, Diesel Generators, Big Cannons,
  Enchantment Industry all current here).
- **Embeddium + Oculus**, not Sodium/Iris (those are Fabric/NeoForge-only on this version).
- **Colorwheel + Colorwheel Patcher** keep Flywheel's GPU backend alive under shaders;
  Euphoria Patches is the one shader pack Colorwheel supports natively.
- **packwiz** so both machines sync from `main`; mods are never committed.

## Client defaults (MacBook Air M5, fanless, 16 GB) are the pack defaults
- DH 192 chunks, FAKE transparency, 2 threads; render distance 8; shader render scale
  0.75 is a per-pack setting (set once Euphoria has produced its folder).
- Client DH generation is **off** — the server generates LODs. Singleplayer test worlds
  will not grow LODs unless `chunkGeneratorMode` is set back to `FEATURES`.
- `preserve = true` on DH, Oculus, Embeddium, Flywheel, Colorwheel, EMF, ETF configs so
  in-game tweaks survive pack updates.
- FML `earlyWindowControl = false` — the early loading window misbehaves on macOS.

## Removed / not added, deliberately
- **ImmediatelyFast** — only a +1.20.4 build was ever present; small gain, not worth a
  wrong-version jar. Re-add only with a `+1.20.1` file.
- **Create: Design n' Decor 0.4.0b** — Create 0.5.1 build; crashed on construct.
- **Explorify, Macaw's BOP addon** — redundant with Structory / Every Compat.
- **Better Caravans** — taste; trade should be a trip or a route you built.
- **Trade Cycling** — hall-adjacent; Restock Balance + Comfort make halls pointless anyway.
- **Project Atmosphere / Weather2** — TAN already owns temperature; no tornadoes.
- **Waystones** — fast travel would undercut the "build the route" premise.
- **Simple Clouds, colored lighting** — need OpenGL 4.2+/compute; macOS tops out at 4.1.
- **Xaero's** — Map Atlases chosen for immersion; one-jar swap if it frustrates.
- **Simply Swords, Apotheosis, Epic Fight, Ice & Fire** — wrong tone or replace too much.

## Dogs
- One dog: **Doggy Talents Next.** Animania's dog breeds are spawn-disabled (cats kept);
  vanilla wolves no longer replaced by Animania; DTN converts tamed wolves (follow-up);
  Pet Home will blacklist wolves (follow-up). Pet Home itself adds no entities.

## Trading
- **No trading halls.** Villager Restock Balance (need bed + bell) and Villager Comfort
  (cramped = expensive) enforce it mechanically.
- **Trading Floor stays**, with the house rule: depots only inside a settlement with beds
  for the villagers using it. Late game = a scheduled train selling into a real town.
- Caravans & Convoys pinned to **1.0.8** because the Village Expansion compat 1.0.1 was
  built against it (1.0.13 broke its `WagonDispatchMixin`). Re-check when the compat updates.

## Keybinds
- `R` shader-reload unbound (Recruits command screen keeps R); Recruits map → `N`
  (Atlas keeps `M`); atlas pin → `P` (Backpack keeps `B`; social interactions unbound);
  Backpacked management unbound (reachable from inventory; quiver keeps `V`).
- Context-scoped shares left alone: Ponder `W`, Create/Railways `Alt`, VS piloting keys.

## Boss gating (Phase 4)
- Gate *expansion* tech only (brass, trains, ships, diesel, cannons, advanced Create);
  never the homestead (water, crops, animals, andesite Create, wagons, docks).
- Unlocks are **server-wide**; the boss drop ("Blueprint") is also a one-time ingredient.
- Material gating (Blueprint as non-consumed ingredient) over hidden recipes — robust on
  1.20.1 without extra mods; recipes stay visible in EMI with a "requires" tooltip.
- Story: village civilization was spread far and wide; the monsters stole its technology;
  the dark age bred the pillagers. Every boss is recovery, not unlocking.
